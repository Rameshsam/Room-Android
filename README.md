# Room-Android
Room persistence library introduced at Google I/O 2017 provides an abstraction layer over the SQLite database which in turn provides enhanced security, easy access, easy to setup and quick to get started with new database. All the DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are now annotated except SELECT command which works with @Query.
